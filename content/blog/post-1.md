**Australian Banks Should Build (APIs) Rather Than Baulk (At Open Banking).**

The open banking revolution seems to be gaining traction in Australia. Treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced on July 20th that Australia’s banking sector will come under review in a bid to figure out how the open banking regime should work in practice by the end of this year.

It remains to be seen whether the financial services sector will meaningfully get on board with “open banking” and how fast they’ll implement the necessary technology infrastructure. For centuries, big banks have enjoyed an undisturbed status, backed by government, high barriers to entry and consumer inertia. Many banking products and services are still poor, dated and expensive.

Until recently, Australia’s big banks have resisted the open banking push, citing security and privacy concerns, and called for the government to leave it to market forces to improve competition. Meanwhile, the open banking regime is gathering pace in the UK and Europe with the European Union’s second payment services directive (PSD2) coming into force in January 2018.

Fintechs, both globally and in Australia, are launching innovative products and services set to lure consumers away from the banks through integrating financial, commercial and social into slick apps. Silicon Valley’s tech giants, notably Google, Facebook and Apple, are also entering the fray.

In the UK and Europe, the mood is certainly shifting from existential fear of disintermediation to enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead and banks now universally see open banking as a strategic opportunity, embracing it proactively and ambitiously. One thing’s certain - taking a sluggish, half hearted approach to open banking will only leave Australian banks exposed to globalised fintech innovation in the foreseeable future.

  
**Open Banking Defined**

Open banking means that banks will have to shift from being one-stop-shops for financial services to open platforms, where consumers can embrace a more modular approach to banking as it becomes easier to compare banks and their products.

This is not just driven by market forces and technology but through legislation. In the EU, UK and now Australia, regulators are pushing the open banking regime which will force banks to share otherwise hidden data (if the consumer consents) and build APIs.

Those APIs will allow third parties to plug into the bank’s underlying services and build products on top of the bank’s infrastructure. APIs are the vital glue that will enable seamless interaction between the banks and new players and facilitate more suitable and efficient products and services. Open banking will therefore force the ‘Big 4’ to rethink their customer engagement models and leverage APIs more effectively to serve increasingly mobile, tech-savvy customers.

Tom Blomfield, CEO of UK challenger bank, Monzo, predicts that “the bank of the future will be a marketplace”. He rightly notes that open banking requires a huge shift in mindset and, much like the music industry’s tight control pre-iTunes, open banking pushes banks to become platform businesses.
