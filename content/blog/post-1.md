**Australian Banks Should Build (APIs) Rather Than Baulk (At Open Banking).**

The open banking revolution seems to be gaining traction in Australia. Treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced on July 20th that Australia’s banking sector will come under review in a bid to figure out how the open banking regime should work in practice by the end of this year.

It remains to be seen whether the financial services sector will meaningfully get on board with “open banking” and how fast they’ll implement the necessary technology infrastructure. For centuries, big banks have enjoyed an undisturbed status, backed by government, high barriers to entry and consumer inertia. Many banking products and services are still poor, dated and expensive.

Until recently, Australia’s big banks have resisted the open banking push, citing security and privacy concerns, and called for the government to leave it to market forces to improve competition. Meanwhile, the open banking regime is gathering pace in the UK and Europe with the European Union’s second payment services directive (PSD2) coming into force in January 2018.

Fintechs, both globally and in Australia, are launching innovative products and services set to lure consumers away from the banks through integrating financial, commercial and social into slick apps. Silicon Valley’s tech giants, notably Google, Facebook and Apple, are also entering the fray.

In the UK and Europe, the mood is certainly shifting from existential fear of disintermediation to enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead and banks now universally see open banking as a strategic opportunity, embracing it proactively and ambitiously. One thing’s certain - taking a sluggish, half hearted approach to open banking will only leave Australian banks exposed to globalised fintech innovation in the foreseeable future.

**Open Banking Defined**

Open banking means that banks will have to shift from being one-stop-shops for financial services to open platforms, where consumers can embrace a more modular approach to banking as it becomes easier to compare banks and their products.

This is not just driven by market forces and technology but through legislation. In the EU, UK and now Australia, regulators are pushing the open banking regime which will force banks to share otherwise hidden data (if the consumer consents) and build APIs.

Those APIs will allow third parties to plug into the bank’s underlying services and build products on top of the bank’s infrastructure. APIs are the vital glue that will enable seamless interaction between the banks and new players and facilitate more suitable and efficient products and services. Open banking will therefore force the ‘Big 4’ to rethink their customer engagement models and leverage APIs more effectively to serve increasingly mobile, tech-savvy customers.

Tom Blomfield, CEO of UK challenger bank, Monzo, predicts that “the bank of the future will be a marketplace”. He rightly notes that open banking requires a huge shift in mindset and, much like the music industry’s tight control pre-iTunes, open banking pushes banks to become platform businesses.

**Australia’s shifting landscape**

Australian banks have, until recently, opposed the push for an open data regime.

As part of the Productivity Commission’s review of whether Australia should adopt a compulsory open banking policy, held in 2016, the Big 4 argued that open banking implementation would be costly and raise security concerns. The Australian Bankers' Association (ABA) said open banking should be allowed to “occur organically”.

But fintechs and venture capital investors have long argued that open banking would increase productivity, reduce costs, time and effort required to switch banks, and empower consumers to use their data to be able to make better financial decisions. It is not hard to see why big banks have pushed back.

In what seems to be a dramatic change of tune from its comments only a year ago, the ABA’s Chief Executive, Anna Bligh, said recently that an open data regime is “just the beginning” of the wave of disruption set to hit Australian banks and open up opportunities for smaller fintech players. Ms Bligh also conceded that “in just a few years banking could look very different than it does today”.

Tech giants’ foray into banking has been the subject of much speculation over the past few years. An Accenture report from January 2017 found that approximately 30% of global respondents would switch to Google, Amazon or Facebook for banking. While Silicon Valley firms may not want to become banks in their own right, they certainly have the advantage of having grown up in the digital age and are well positioned to win over banking customers with cutting edge websites and superior apps.

Facebook was recently reported to have won an Australian patent for technology that would allow peer to peer payments via its messenger service, much to the dismay of local banks who have reportedly spent over $1 billion on their own P2P payment network.

There is no doubt that financial industry incumbents will have their work cut out.

**Fintechs on the rise**

The [**World Retail Banking Report 2017**](https://www.worldretailbankingreport.com/) (recently published by Capgemini and Efma) (WRBR) explored how banking is evolving into an open-source model and urged banks to embrace and lead this evolution to maintain and build customer relationships and avoid disintermediation. The Report notes that banks collaboration with fintechs is key in order to offer more innovative and personalised services. While banks have traditionally reacted to fintech with a mix of denial and suspicion, it seems that global attitudes are changing, with over 90% of global banks and over 75% of fintechs surveyed in the WRBR saying they expect to collaborate in the future.

The report also highlights that fintechs earn high marks when it comes to customer experience and that global trends show that young, tech savvy customers are likely to turn to fintechs for financial services. This is hardly surprising, with the vast majority of millennials already banking on their mobile and laptops, using digital wallets and peer-to-peer payment apps. Banks are clearly coming to terms with the new reality in which their traditional, complacent customer base, scale and trusted brands won’t necessarily guarantee their future survival.

As Pietro Sella, CEO of Banca Sella and longtime open banking advocate, rightly says banking is at a similar inflection point to that of the telecoms sector a few years ago:

> _“ Think about WhatsApp and similar services. When they took control of the contact list on smartphones, they took the entire SMS market from the telcos. The mistake the telcos made was to not move forward in a legacy area; to not create the synergies that are possible when everyone has the same kind of platform or solution. Banks could cooperate in order to save costs in areas where there is no longer competitive advantage and to create platforms that let them compete in new areas and capture new customers.”_
