**“...We need to take on the apologists. Though few executives admit to being fans of bureaucracy, fewer still seem genuinely committed to killing it.” - Gary Hamel**

## 1. The bureaucratic elephant in the room

Like many people in tech today, I’d like to see the transformation conversation rise above ground level discussions of tools, t-shirts and “[**spotify models**](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/)”. As consultants, we politely graze the symptoms when we evangelise about changing “cultures” and adopting a “devops mindset”. But bureaucracy - the multi-tiered elephant in the room that’s butchering productivity and costing us trillions of dollars globally - is rarely called out in this context.

Today, we simultaneously co-inhabit two conflicting ideological eras. On the one hand, in the world of “bits”, we are embracing complexity head on, building ever more interconnected, distributed and resilient systems and champion speed and agility. On the other hand, in the world of organisational structures, we’re still comfortably operating in monolithic bureaucratic hierarchical structures (that date back to the early 1900's) and label our people as “resources” (in fact, there’s a whole department named after that in most organisations).

Bureaucrats are heavily attracted to the illusion of certainty, pursuing standard, quantifiable cost-cutting ‘efficiencies’ without considering delayed or hidden costs such as driving out good people, stifling innovation and hampering decision-making. But decentralisation and resilience-building principles that have been used by software engineering for more than 20 years may hold the answer for boosting productivity, treating chronic stagnation and creating game changing innovation.

### **The Global Productivity Problem**

Productivity slowdown is a [**global problem**](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/03/productivity-slowdown-imf-christine-lagarde). In recent years, both the [**IMF**](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2017/04/03/Gone-with-the-Headwinds-Global-Productivity-44758) and [**OECD**](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/productivity-stats/oecd-compendium-of-productivity-indicators-22252126.htm) pointed out that global productivity fell sharply following the GFC and has remained sluggish since, adding to a slowdown already in train before. The [**Australian economy**](https://www.ceda.com.au/Digital-hub/Blogs/CEDA-Blog/April-2020/What-COVID-19-means-for-Australian-productivity) went into the COVID-19 pandemic with weak growth in both productivity and average incomes. In 2018-19, Australia’s labour and multifactor productivity went backwards, while growth in per capita income slowed to just 0.3%. Suppressing the pandemic will come at a large cost to economic activity with [**Australia heading into its deepest downturn in almost 100 years**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/australia-economy-news-deepest-downturn-in-90-years-is-coming). As any economist will tell you, productivity growth is the key driver of prosperity. When productivity increases, so do incomes and living standards. Slow productivity growth can create economic and social instability.

Like many in the industry, I’m a believer in the “continuous improvement” ethos that inspired the “DevOps” approach to problem solving. These grass-roots movements were intended to unlock productivity and empower engineers to improve their own work environments and deliver more economic value. As tactical approaches, they are undoubtedly valid constructs for supporting agility, collaboration and innovation. But the root of the so-called “productivity problem”, both in the tech space and, more broadly, in today’s global economies and organisations, lies in a dated technology that is sadly still holding us hostage today: _bureaucracy_.

### **The Bureaucracy Tax**

Prof. Gary Hamel, a Harvard Business School Professor who’s been writing about the dreaded “B word” since the 90’s, makes a powerful point in his 2016 paper “[**The $3 Trillion Prize for Busting Bureaucracy (and how to claim it)**](http://www.garyhamel.com/blog/3-trillion)“:

_“...like all technologies, bureaucracy is a product of its time. In the century and a half since its invention, much has changed. Today’s employees are skilled, not illiterate. Communication is instantaneous rather than tortuous; and the pace of change is exponential rather than glacial. Nevertheless, the foundations of management are still cemented in bureaucracy.”_

Prof. Hamel estimates the true cost of excess bureaucracy northwards of US$3 trillion annually (approximately 17% of the US’s GDP). In Australia, the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) estimates that red tape and government bureaucracy alone is costing the taxpayer [**$176bn and 10% of GDP in 2019.**](https://ipa.org.au/publications-ipa/red-tape-is-costing-australia-176b-a-year) As Prof. Hamel writes “...[**Band-Aids, braces and bariatric surgery don’t fix genetic disorders**](http://www.garyhamel.com/blog/reinventing-management-mashup-architecture-ideology)”. “[**Bureaucracy must die**](https://hbr.org/2014/11/bureaucracy-must-die)”. To address the global problem of sluggish productivity, we need to start by scrutinising the architecture and ideology of modern management.

### The Problem with Bureaucracy today

> “.....bureaucracy is a massive, multi-player game. It’s the field upon which millions of human beings compete for status and wealth. As in all games, some skills are more germane than others. While expertise and execution count for much in bureaucracies, other skills are often even more valuable: deflecting blame, defending turf, managing up, hoarding resources, trading favors, negotiating targets and avoiding scrutiny.” - **Gary Hamel**
