Hi I'm Dan, I'm an engineer, entrepreneur and life-long learner. Over the last 20 years, curiosity has taken me to many countries. I've travelled extensively for fun and worked in 10 countries in various sectors including consulting, cloud infrastructure, electronic trading, e-commerce as well as three startups of my own.
