Hi I'm Dan. I'm an engineer, entrepreneur and life-long learner. Over the last 20 years, I've travelled extensively & worked in 10 countries, across multiple sectors including consulting, cloud infrastructure, electronic trading, e-commerce as well as established three start-ups of my own.

I'm passionate about knowledge sharing within the tech community and increasing awareness of tech literacy & innovation in Australia.
